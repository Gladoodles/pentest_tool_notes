# Steghide Usage Guide
## Basic Usage
#### Hiding Data
To hide data within an image file (cover file), use the following command:
```text
steghide embed -ef [file_to_hide.txt] -cf [cover_image.jpg] -sf [output_image.jpg]
```
Replace:
- [file_to_hide.txt] with the path to the file you want to hide.
- [cover_image.jpg] with the path to the cover image.
- [output_image.jpg] with the desired name for the output image.

You will be prompted to set a passphrase for encryption.

#### Extracting Data

To extract hidden data from an image file, use the following command:
```text
steghide extract -sf [steg_image.jpg]
```
Replace <steg_image.jpg> with the path to the image containing hidden data. If the hidden data is encrypted, you will be prompted to enter the passphrase.

#### Advanced Options
Setting a Passphrase

You can set a passphrase during embedding to encrypt the hidden data:
```text
steghide embed -ef [file_to_hide.txt] -cf [cover_image.jpg] -sf [output_image.jpg] -p [passphrase]
```

#### Verbose Mode
Enable verbose mode for more detailed output:
```text
steghide embed -ef [file_to_hide.txt] -cf [cover_image.jpg] -sf [output_image.jpg] -v
```
