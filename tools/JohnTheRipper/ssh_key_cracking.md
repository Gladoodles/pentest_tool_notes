For when you are connecting to an SSH sessions and you are prompted for a password that you do not know. 

Step 1: change the permissions of the key using the chmod command:

chmod 600 [ssh_key]
```
Step 2: convert the key to a hash value using ssh2john:
```text
ssh2john.py [ssh_key] > [hash_value].txt
```
Step 3: crack the hash using john:
```text
john [hash_value].txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > cracked.txt
