# HASHCAT
#### Attack Mode: Straight
Step 1: save the hashes obtained to a file:
```text
echo '[hashes]' > tocrack.txt
```
Add more hashes to a file if necessary: 
```text
echo '[hashes]' >> tocrack.txt
```
Note: if you are cracking a hash that contains a salt then make sure the saved tocrack.txt is formatted correctly by separating the hash and the salt by a colon ':', like this:
```text
[the_hash_value]:[the_salt_value]
6d05358f090eea56a238af02e47d44ee5489d234810ef6240280857ec69712a3e5e370b8a41899d0196ade16c0d54327c5654019292cbfe0b5e98ad1fec71bed:1c362db832f3f864c8c2fe05f2002a05
```
Step 2: if not already known, identify the hash type:
```text
hashid '[hash_example]'
```
Step 3: depending on the hashid output identify the hash type code needed for the -m value to be used later:
```text
hashcat --help | grep [hash_type]
```
Example output:
```text
hashcat --help | grep sha

1740 | sha512($salt.utf16le($pass))                               | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
1730 | sha512(utf16le($pass).$salt)                               | Raw Hash salted and/or iterated
```
Step 4: start cracking the hash:
```text
hashcat -m [hash_type_code] -a 0 [tocrack].txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
Example:
- -m identifies the hash type and -a identifies the attack type, in this instance it is 0 which is a simple wordlist attack.
```text
hashcat -m 1730 -a 0 tocrack.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
