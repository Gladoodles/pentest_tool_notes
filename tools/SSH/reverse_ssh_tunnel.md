# REVERSE SSH TUNNELS 
```text
ssh -L [port]:localhost:[port] [username]@[ip_address]
```
On your browser you can then naviage to:
```text
localhost:[port]
```
#### EXPLINATION
For example you manage to get a foothold on a machine using SSH and you run the command ss -tulpn (or netstat) and see a port listening on port 1234. You try to access the service running on port 1234 but you suspect it is being blocked by a firewall. 

From your machine you can create a reverse SSH tunnel to access that service and the connect to it locally on your own browser.
