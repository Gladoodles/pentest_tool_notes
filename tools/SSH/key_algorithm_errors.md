# KEY ALGORITHM ERRORS
This may be useful if you get the following error when attempting to connect to a machine:
```text
Unable to negotiate with 192.168.100.100 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa
```
Enter the following ssh command to connect:
```text
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss [username]@[ip_address]
```
Also works when using different ports and no username:
```text
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss [ip_address] -p [port_number]
```
