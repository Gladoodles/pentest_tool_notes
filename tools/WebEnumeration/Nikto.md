# NIKTO
#### Basic Scanning
This will look for headers (Apache2, Apache Tomcat, Jenkins or JBoss) and any sensitive directories. 
```text
nikto -h [url]
```
To look out for:
- HTTP methods: PUT and DELETE can be performed by clients.
- Headers to see what type of server it is.

#### Scanning Multiple Hosts and Ports
You can input directly from NMAP to scan a subnet. 
```text
nmap -p 80 [ip_address/CIDR] -oG - | nikto -h -
```
Scan a single host but multiple ports.
```text
nikto -h [ip_address] -p 80,8000,8080
```

```text

```
