# NIKTO
#### Basic Scanning
This will look for headers (Apache2, Apache Tomcat, Jenkins or JBoss) and any sensitive directories. 
```text
nikto -h [url]
```
To look out for:
- HTTP methods: PUT and DELETE can be performed by clients.
- Headers to see what type of server it is.

#### Scanning Multiple Hosts and Ports
You can input directly from NMAP to scan a subnet. 
```text
nmap -p 80 [ip_address/CIDR] -oG - | nikto -h -
```
Scan a single host but multiple ports.
```text
nikto -h [ip_address] -p 80,8000,8080
```
#### Plugins
To see a list of plugins:
```text
--list-plugins
```
Use a plugin:
```text
nikto -h [ip_address] -Plugin [plugin-name]
```
Useful plugins:
- apacheusers (enumerate apache http authentication users)
- cgi (enumerate cgi scripts to exploit)
- robots (analyse the robots.txt)
- dir_traversal (attempt directory traversal attack)

#### Verbosing 
Add the following flag:
```text
-Display [1 or 2 or E]
```
#### Vulnerability Scanning

```text
-Tuning [option]
```
Options:
- File Upload = 0
- Misconfiguration / Default Files = 2
