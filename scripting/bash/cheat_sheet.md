# BASIC BASH SCRIPTING

### Bash Shebang
Start with a Bash Shebang to tell the computer to use the bash intepreter:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
```
### Variables
Create a variable:
```sh
hello="Kon'nichiwa"
echo $hello
```
### Conditionals
This is a basic Bash script structure using conditionals. It checks a condition using [ ] syntax, then executes specific code blocks depending on whether the condition is true (then block) or false (else block). The entire conditional structure is closed with fi.
```sh
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to run if condition is met
else
    # Code to run if condition is not met
fi

# Check if a file exists
if [ -f "example.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
else
    echo "File does not exist"
fi
```
List of conditionals:
- Equal: ==
- Not equal: !=
- Equal: -eq
- Not equal: -ne
- Less than or equal: -le
- Less than: -lt
- Greater than or equal: -ge
- Greater than: -gt
- Is null: -z
### For Loops
A for loop in Bash is a control flow statement that iterates over a sequence of values and executes a set of commands for each value in the sequence.
```sh
ip_addresses="10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3"

for ip in $ip_addresses
do
  echo $ip
done
```
### While Loops
A while loop in Bash is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a set of commands as long as a specified condition is true.
```sh
sequence=2

while [ $sequence -lt 3 ]
do
  echo $sequence
  sequence=$((sequence + 1))
done
```

### Until Loops
An until loop in Bash is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a set of commands until a specified condition becomes true.
```sh
sequence=2

until [ $sequence -eq 10 ]
do
  echo $sequence
  sequence=$((sequence + 1))
done
```
