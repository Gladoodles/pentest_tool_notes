# BASIC BASH SCRIPTING

### Bash Shebang
Start with a Bash Shebang to tell the computer to use the bash intepreter:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
```
### Variables
Create a variable:
```sh
hello="Kon'nichiwa"
echo $hello
```
### Conditionals
This is a basic Bash script structure using conditionals. It checks a condition using [ ] syntax, then executes specific code blocks depending on whether the condition is true (then block) or false (else block). The entire conditional structure is closed with fi.
```sh
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to run if condition is met
else
    # Code to run if condition is not met
fi

# Check if a file exists
if [ -f "example.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
else
    echo "File does not exist"
fi
```
List of conditionals:

- Equal: -eq
- Not equal: -ne
- Less than or equal: -le
- Less than: -lt
- Greater than or equal: -ge
- Greater than: -gt
- Is null: -z
